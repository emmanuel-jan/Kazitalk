                      Depending on client needs, KaziTalk can be hosted on the

                      on the AWS data center while managing the IT
                      infrastructure â€” software and hardware â€” necessary to run
                      KaziTalk. For on-premise hosting, we install KaziTalk on
                      your own IT infrastructure using your own hardware,
                      network, and other IT resources.
